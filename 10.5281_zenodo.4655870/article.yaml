abstract: "Neurodynamical models of working memory (WM) should provide mechanisms
for storing, maintaining, retrieving, and deleting information. Raznan Pascanu and
Herbert Jaeger have suggested that memory states correspond, intuitively in terms of
nonlinear dynamics, to attractors in an input-driven system, giving a simple WM model
training all performance modes into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) of the Echo State
Network (ESN) type.
In this replication, we reproduced this WM model in Python in order to see wether or
not these observations could be observed on a slightly different model made from scratch."
