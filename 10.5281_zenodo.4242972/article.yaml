abstract: "This article endeavours to reproduce the experimental study of
           B.~Büeler, A.~Enge, K.~Fukuda:
	   \\textit {Exact Volume Computation for Polytopes: A Practical Study},
	   2000, in which a variety of algorithms for volume computation are
	   applied to a variety of different higher-dimensional polytopes.
	   The original software is used on a modern machine to redo the
	   computations. It turns out that due to Moore's law, running times
	   go down, but the original conclusions are still valid."
