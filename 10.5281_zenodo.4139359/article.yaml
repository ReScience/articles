abstract: "The visual cortex has long been the subject of study for computational
           neuroscientists. Various neural network techniques have been applied
           in attempts to recreate the receptive fields found experimentally in
           visual cortex cells. In 1991 Hancock et al used an algorithm designed
           by Sanger in 1989 to perform Principal Component Analysis on a series
           of natural greyscale images, which replicated some features of 
           receptive fields found in the V1 of cats, although they noted that 
           many of the complex principal components were not found. Moreover,
           they showed that Sanger's algorithm was able to find distinguishing 
           features in text images as well as natural images, an important find in
           the study of neural networks."
