# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "This paper presents a replication of the CHISEL debloating system with some clarifications on caveats of the original method.
           It also presents a new property testing method using unit tests.
           The original results are extended with numerical proves of the improvements linked to the Reinforcement
           Learning part of the CHISEL system compared to the original HDD system.
           Several Python librairies are debloated and the improvements in terms of number of iterations and time consumption are presented.
           The results show that the RL part of CHISEL significantly improves the original HDD algorithm."
