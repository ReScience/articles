# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "
Hastings & Powell's model describing chaos in a three-species food chain is a classic in
ecological modelling.
Here, we provide a successul reproduction of the model and results from the original
article, implemented in Julia v1.3.1 and openly accessible online.
The main challenge we faced was the absence of the initial conditions from the
original article. Our reproduction nonetheless displays the same results, although with slight differences,
and confirms chaos arising in a three species food chain in continuous time.
