# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "A stochastic ensemble simulation of evolutionary dynamics has been successfully reproduced. Simulation code was in C and could be called from wrappers implemented as an R package.  Reproduction required minor modification to the configuration files for compatibility with newer versions of the GNU Scientific Library."
