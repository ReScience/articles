abstract: "In 2006, during my PhD, I published my first modelling paper showing that the normal and pathological dynamics of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical network could be understood from a theoretical standpoint relying on a simplified model of the circuit. I recently was told by a colleague about a challenge to reproduce modelling studies over 10-years old. I was quite confident I could reproduce the results of my 2006 paper, which was based on a combination of analytical calculation and computer simulations programmed in C with figures produced through Matlab custom code. All the code was still saved on my computer (although in a simple but relatively messy file-and-folder organisation), and I went through my personal archives and re-run ancient code until I could provide again the results described here.
