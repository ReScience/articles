# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "This is the description of a partly successful replication of a study of electrophysiological brain signals
implemented 15 years ago in Matlab, motivated by ReScience's Ten Years Reproducibility Challenge. In the original study, the phenomenon of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) was investigated in the hippocampus, a brain structure pivotal for navigation and the formation of memory."
