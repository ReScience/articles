abstract: "This article reports on the experience of reproducing a computational modelling study I
originally carried out as part of my PhD studies, which was published as Davison, Feng,
and Brown (2003). The reproduced figures were not quantitatively identical to the originals
due to differences in the sequences of random numbers obtained, but population responses
were quantitatively very similar, and the major findings of the original study
are unchanged in the reproduction. We attribute the relative ease of the reproduction to the
use of the NEURON simulator and the Gnuplot graphics application, both of which have
been continuously maintained since the original publication, and have largely preserved
backwards compatibility."
