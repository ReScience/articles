abstract: "Is a scientific research paper based on (i) public, online
          observational data files and (ii) providing free-licensed
          software for reproducing its results easy to reproduce by
          the same author a decade later? This paper attempts to
          reproduce a cosmic topology observational paper published in
          2008 and satisfying both criteria (i) and (ii). The
          reproduction steps are defined formally in a free-licensed
          git repository package ``0807.4260'' and qualitatively in
          the current paper. It was found that the effort in upgrading
          the Fortran 77 code at the heart of the software, interfaced
          with a C front end, and originally compiled with g77,
          in the content of the contemporary gfortran compiler,
          risked being too great to be justified on any short time
          scale. In this sense, the results of RBG08 are not as
          reproducible as they appeared to be, despite both (i) data
          availability and (ii) free-licensing and public availability of
          the software. The software and a script to reproduce the
          steps of this incomplete reproduction are combined in a new
          git repository named 0807.4260, following the ArXiv identity
          code of RBG08."
