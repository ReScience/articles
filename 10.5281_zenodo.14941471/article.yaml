abstract: "Label smoothing is a technique that can make neural network classifiers less overconfident in their predictions and reduce overfitting, resulting in more reliable and accurate results. It's widely used but poorly understood. The replicated paper on label smoothing presents empirical evidence that it improves generalization and model calibration, and investigates its behavior in knowledge distillation.\\\\ 
In this paper, we seek to validate the authors' findings by re-implementing the original experiments, including the models and datasets, using PyTorch. Moreover, we evaluate the experiments on additional datasets and models, which align with the authors' conclusions. Furthermore, we establish a concrete mathematical foundation to recreate the penultimate layer representation presented in the original paper."
