# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "Reproduction report for C. H. Robert, Estimating friction coefficients of mixed globular/chain molecules, such as protein/DNA complexes. The original Mathematica notebook code, with very few modifications, was used with the most recent Mathematica version 12.0 to reproduce the data plotted in the original article."
