# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "As part of the ReScience Ten Years Reproducibility
    Challenge, I sought to reproduce the analyses in Bond-Lamberty et
    al. (2009). The R program file for this paper was available,
    although it was unpublished and undocumented, but a full output
    file from the original analysis was available. The results were
    essentially reproduced, with one or two minor changes in e.g. the
    sixth decimal place of a few numbers. The original choice to use
    only base R functions imposed limitations but also enhanced
    reproducibility, given that software's historical emphasis on
    backward compatibility."
