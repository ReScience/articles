# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "This paper describes the successful reproduction of a paper
I co-authored in 2008 (Eglen and Wong, 2008), as part of the ten year
reproducibility challenge.  This work was done in the R programming
language, and thanks to the stability of R, the code could be re-run
without any problems.  In this paper I discuss the scientific
background and the steps needed to recreate the key results from our
2008 paper."
