abstract: "The basal nucleus of the amygdala (BA) is related to the process
of creating memories of conditioned fear and extinction that are both dependent
on the context. Vlacho and collaborators developed two models of neural networks
to study the effect of plasticity based on a specific phenomenological rule in BA
excitatory neurons. When an excitatory subpopulation receives conditioned stimulus
(CS) and contextual inputs in narrow time windows, synaptic weights are potentiated
by this effect, increasing the subpopulation's firing rate related to the specified
context. In this replication, we implemented the models using Python (for the mean-field
model) and Brian 2 (for the spiking neuron model), and we were able to reproduce the
original results qualitatively. In order to replicate the model, it was necessary to
estimate a considerable amount of parameters and to adapt some of the protocols that
were either ambiguous or absent in the methodological descriptions of the original work."
